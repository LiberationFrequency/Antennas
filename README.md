What is it?  
-----------------------------------
Some .nec-files of antennas that I modelled with 4nec2 for fun. I made them a half year ago, but unfortunately I run into trouble with 4nec2 and wine, so I can't test them again. I added some screenshots, that's slightly too big, but maybe it can help to troubleshooting, if the application doesn't work anymore.
